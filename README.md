<h1>A  Gramophone</h1>
<p><strong>Currently deprecated</strong> in favor of the new, independent Floridaman theme. It's gotten to the point where my baby can live on his own.</p>
<p>This is an adaptation as a labor of love for the website, Florida Man Photography. I have, or am in the process of, adding features specifically to enhance a photographer's web site and store.</p>
<h2>Minimally Opinionated Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Conditionally rendered navbars</li>
<li>Non-sticky footer flushed to bottom</li>
<li>Theme Customizer API support
</ul>
